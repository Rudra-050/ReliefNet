## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### No Backend Required ✅
All services use **existing backend endpoints**:
- Mental Health Support → `/api/doctors`
- Therapy Sessions → Booking system (existing)
- Chat with Doctors → Chat/WebSocket (existing)
- Placeholders navigate to Home (can be expanded later)

### Code Structure
```kotlin
// Data Model
data class Service(
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val backgroundColor: Color,
    val imageRes: Int,
    val route: String
)

// Main Screen with TopBar + LazyColumn
@Composable
fun ServicesScreen(navHostController: NavHostController)

// Individual Service Card
@Composable
fun ServiceCard(service: Service, cardWidth: Dp, onClick: () -> Unit)
```

## 📱 How to Use

### From Home Screen:
1. User sees "Our Services" section
2. Clicks on "Our Services" text or "View All →" link
3. Navigates to full Services page
4. Browses all 6 service options
5. Clicks any service card to access that feature

### From Services Screen:
- **Back button** in top bar returns to Home
- **Each card** navigates to its respective screen
- **Bottom navigation** bar for quick app navigation
