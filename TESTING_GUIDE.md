## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deep link not opening app
**Check**: 
```bash
adb shell dumpsys package com.sentrive.reliefnet | grep "Deep Links"
```
**Fix**: Verify AndroidManifest.xml intent filters

### Issue: Payment verification fails
**Check backend logs**: 
```bash
tail -f server/logs/app.log
```
**Fix**: Ensure webhook URL is accessible

### Issue: Booking not created
**Check**: Payment status in database
**Fix**: Verify payment status is "SUCCESS" before booking

### Issue: Navigation not working
**Check logs**: 
```bash
adb logcat | grep Navigation
```
**Fix**: Verify routes are registered in Navigation.kt
