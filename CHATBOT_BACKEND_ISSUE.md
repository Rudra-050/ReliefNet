  "message": "I'm feeling anxious",
  "user_id": "test_123"
}
```

### Current Response:

{
  "response": "⚠️ I couldn't connect to the support assistant right now. Please try again later."
}
```

## What We Need

For the Android app to work properly, we need:

1. ✅ Backend to accept POST requests to `/chat` (WORKING)
2. ✅ Accept JSON with `message` and `user_id` (WORKING)
3. ⚠️ **Return AI-generated responses** (NOT WORKING)
4. ⚠️ Maintain conversation context per user_id (UNKNOWN)

## Android App Status

**Our side (Android app) is ready:**
- ✅ ChatbotViewModel implemented
- ✅ API client configured with correct URL
- ✅ RelieScreen → RelieChat navigation working
- ✅ Message sending implemented
- ✅ UI/UX complete

**We just need the backend AI to start responding!**

---

## Next Steps

**For Backend Team:**
1. Check Render dashboard logs
2. Verify AI API key is configured
3. Test the `/chat` endpoint
4. Let us know when it's fixed

**For Android Team (us):**
1. We can test the app now (will show fallback messages)
2. Once backend is fixed, retest
3. No code changes needed on our side

## Temporary Workaround

The Android app can be tested and demonstrated with the fallback message. The navigation flow, UI, and API integration all work correctly. Once the backend AI is configured, the app will automatically start showing real AI responses with no code changes needed.
