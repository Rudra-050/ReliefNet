---

## Problem Statement

### Initial Requirement
User wanted to implement Google Pay for consultation payments in the ReliefNet healthcare app.

### Problem Evolution
1. **Google Pay limitation**: No API-based verification, only manual UPI transaction tracking
2. **Business model issue**: Doctors needed direct payments to their accounts (marketplace model)
3. **Split payment need**: Platform commission (10%) + Doctor earnings (90%)
4. **Cost consideration**: User wanted lowest transaction fees

### Solution Chosen
**PhonePe Payment Gateway** selected from 6 alternatives for:
- Lowest fees in market: **1.5-1.8%** (vs competitors: 2-2.5%)
- Largest user base: **450M+ users** in India
- Built-in marketplace/split payment support
- UPI-first approach (preferred by Indian users)
- Fast settlement: T+1 or same-day

---

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js + Express) - ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Dependencies Added
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');  // HMAC SHA256 signature verification
const axios = require('axios');    // PhonePe API HTTP calls
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration
Required `.env` variables:
```env
PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
PHONEPE_SALT_KEY=your_salt_key
PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX=1
PHONEPE_ENV=test  # or 'production'
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

#### 3. Payment Schema Updated
```javascript
{
  phonepeTransactionId: String (unique),      // PhonePe's transaction ID
  phonepeMerchantTransactionId: String,       // Our generated ID
  status: 'PENDING' | 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILED' | 'CANCELLED',
  paymentMethod: 'phonepe',
  doctorAmount: Number,     // 90% of total
  platformFee: Number,      // 10% of total
  paymentInstrument: String // UPI/CARD/NETBANKING
}
```

#### 4. API Endpoints Implemented

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/api/payments/create-order` | POST | Create payment order | ✅ |
| `/api/payments/check-status` | POST | Check payment status | ✅ |
| `/api/payments/webhook` | POST | PhonePe callback handler | ✅ |
| `/api/payments/callback` | POST | Browser redirect handler | ✅ |
| `/api/payments/confirm` | POST | Verify & create booking | ✅ |

#### 5. Security Implemented
- ✅ HMAC SHA256 checksum generation for all requests
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Duplicate payment prevention (unique transaction IDs)
- ✅ Amount validation
- ✅ Payment status verification before booking creation

#### 6. Split Payment Logic
```
Example: ₹500 consultation fee
├── Doctor receives: ₹450 (90%)
└── Platform keeps: ₹50 (10%)
```

**Calculation**:
```javascript
const platformFeePercent = 0.10;
const platformFee = Math.round(amount * platformFeePercent * 100) / 100;
const doctorAmount = amount - platformFee;
```

---

### Android Implementation - ⚠️ PENDING

#### Required Changes

1. **Add PhonePe SDK** to `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
implementation("phonepe.intentsdk.android:IntentSDK:2.4.1")
```

2. **Update `AndroidManifest.xml`** for deep links:
```xml
<data android:scheme="reliefnet" android:host="payment" />
```

3. **Create `PhonePeHelper.kt`**:
- Initialize PhonePe SDK
- Handle payment flow
- Process payment results

4. **Update API Models** (`ApiModels.kt`):
- `CreatePaymentOrderRequest`
- `CreatePaymentOrderResponse`
- `CheckPaymentStatusRequest`
- `ConfirmPaymentRequest`

5. **Update API Service** (`ApiService.kt`):
- Add PhonePe payment endpoints

6. **Update Booking UI**:
- Integrate payment flow
- Handle payment callbacks
- Show success/failure screens

---

## Payment Flow Architecture

### Complete User Journey
```
1. Patient selects doctor + time slot
   ↓
2. Patient clicks "Book & Pay"
   ↓
3. App → Backend: POST /api/payments/create-order
   ↓
4. Backend → PhonePe: Create payment order
   ↓
5. Backend → App: Return payment URL + merchantTransactionId
   ↓
6. App: Open payment URL (browser/WebView) or PhonePe SDK
   ↓
7. Patient: Complete payment (UPI/Card/Netbanking)
   ↓
8. PhonePe → Backend: POST /api/payments/webhook (async)
   ↓
9. Backend: Verify signature, update payment status
   ↓
10. PhonePe → Browser: Redirect to callback URL
   ↓
11. Backend → App: Deep link (reliefnet://payment/success)
   ↓
12. App → Backend: POST /api/payments/check-status
   ↓
13. Backend → PhonePe: Check payment status
   ↓
14. App → Backend: POST /api/payments/confirm
   ↓
15. Backend: Create booking + Send notifications
   ↓
16. App: Show success screen with booking details
```

### Webhook vs Callback
- **Webhook**: Server-to-server (reliable, instant, secure)
- **Callback**: Browser redirect (user-facing, not reliable for state updates)
- **Best Practice**: Use webhook for database updates, callback for UI feedback

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Why PhonePe over Google Pay?
| Feature | Google Pay | PhonePe Gateway |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| API Integration | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Verification | Manual | Automatic |
| Split Payments | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Transaction Fees | Free (but manual) | 1.5-1.8% (automated) |
| Doctor Payouts | Manual bank transfer | Automatic |
| Status Tracking | Manual | Real-time webhooks |
| Production Ready | No | Yes |

**Verdict**: PhonePe gateway is essential for marketplace model where doctors need automatic payouts.

### 2. Why 90/10 Split?
- **10% platform fee** covers:
  - Payment gateway fees (1.5-1.8%)
  - Server costs
  - Support and operations
  - Future development
  - Profit margin: ~8%

- **90% to doctors** because:
  - Competitive with other platforms (typically 80-85%)
  - Doctors are the core asset
  - Higher earnings = better retention
  - Encourages quality service

### 3. Why Webhook + Callback Both?
- **Webhook**: Updates database reliably (server-to-server)
- **Callback**: Updates UI immediately (better UX)
- **Together**: Best of both worlds - reliable data + responsive UI

---

## Testing Strategy

### Sandbox Testing (Current)
1. **Get sandbox credentials** from PhonePe business dashboard
2. **Use test cards**:
   ```
   Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   CVV: Any 3 digits
   Expiry: Future date
   ```
3. **Use test UPI**:
   ```
   success@ybl - Payment success
   failure@ybl - Payment failure
   ```
4. **Test webhook with ngrok**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   # Update webhook URL in PhonePe dashboard
   ```

### Production Testing (Before Launch)
1. **Test with ₹1 transactions** (minimum amount)
2. **Verify split accuracy**: Check doctor gets exactly 90%
3. **Test all payment methods**: UPI, cards, netbanking
4. **Test failure scenarios**: Network issues, timeouts, cancellations
5. **Verify webhooks**: Check all webhook statuses handled
6. **Test refunds**: If booking cancelled within 24h

## Cost Analysis

### Per ₹500 Transaction
| Gateway | Fee | Doctor Gets | Platform Gets | Platform Profit |
|---------|-----|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| PhonePe | ₹7.5-9 | ₹450 | ₹50 | ₹41-42.5 |
| Razorpay | ₹10 | ₹450 | ₹50 | ₹40 |
| Cashfree | ₹9.75 | ₹450 | ₹50 | ₹40.25 |
| PayU | ₹10-12.5 | ₹450 | ₹50 | ₹37.5-40 |

**PhonePe saves ₹0.75-3 per transaction** = Better margins at scale

### Monthly Projection (100 bookings)
```
Revenue: 100 × ₹50 = ₹5,000
Gateway fees: 100 × ₹7.5 = -₹750
Net profit: ₹4,250

With Razorpay:
Gateway fees: 100 × ₹10 = -₹1,000
Net profit: ₹4,000

Monthly savings with PhonePe: ₹250
Annual savings: ₹3,000
```

## Doctor Payout System (TODO)

### Current Status
Split calculation implemented ✅, but actual payout to doctor bank accounts NOT implemented ⚠️

### What's Needed
1. **Database schema** for doctor bank details:
```javascript
Doctor schema additions:
{
  bankAccount: {
    accountNumber: String,
    ifscCode: String,
    accountHolderName: String,
    panNumber: String,
    verified: Boolean
  }
}
```

2. **Payout API integration**:
```javascript
async function processDoctorPayout(doctorId, amount, txnId) {
  // Get doctor bank details
  // Call PhonePe payout API
  // Create DoctorPayout record
  // Update payment record with payout ID
  // Send notification to doctor
}
```

3. **DoctorPayout model** to track transfers:
```javascript
{
  doctorId: ObjectId,
  paymentId: ObjectId,
  amount: Number,
  status: 'PENDING' | 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILED',
  phonepePayoutId: String,
  settlementDate: Date
}
```

### Payout Schedule Options
- **Instant**: After each successful payment (higher fees)
- **Daily**: End of day settlement
- **Weekly**: Every Friday (most common)
- **Monthly**: 1st of each month

**Recommendation**: Daily settlements with instant option for verified doctors

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. ⚠️ **No Android integration**: Backend ready, Android pending
2. ⚠️ **No doctor payouts**: Split calculated but not transferred
3. ⚠️ **No refund handling**: If booking cancelled, manual refund needed
4. ⚠️ **Sandbox only**: Production credentials not configured
5. ⚠️ **No retry logic**: Failed payments not automatically retried

### Future Improvements
1. ⚠️ Add EMI support for expensive treatments
2. ⚠️ Multiple currency support (if expanding internationally)
