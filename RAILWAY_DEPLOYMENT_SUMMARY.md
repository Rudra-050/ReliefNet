## 🔧 Key Configuration Points

### 1. Environment Variables

All sensitive data goes in Railway Variables tab:

```env
# Required
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxx
JWT_SECRET=generated_secret

# Firebase (choose one method)
# Method 1: Individual vars
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxx
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=xxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Method 2: Base64 encoded
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=base64_string
```

### 2. MongoDB Whitelist

**CRITICAL:** Must allow Railway to connect

```
IP Address: 0.0.0.0/0
Comment: Allow Railway (all IPs)
```

### 3. CORS Configuration

Allow your frontend domains:

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourfrontend.com,capacitor://localhost
```

---

## 📱 Update Android App

After deployment, update your API base URL:

**In Android project** (e.g., `ApiService.kt`):

```kotlin
object ApiConfig {
    const val BASE_URL = "https://your-railway-app.railway.app/"
}
```

**Build release APK:**

```bash
cd Reliefnet-android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test Health

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

### Test OTP (with your email)

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/auth/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your@email.com"}'
```

### Run Full Test Suite

```powershell
.\test-railway-deployment.ps1 -RailwayUrl "https://your-app.railway.app"
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### View Logs

1. Railway Dashboard
2. Your Project → Your Service
3. Deployments → Active Deployment
4. Real-time logs appear

### Watch for Errors

Common issues to monitor:
- MongoDB connection failures
- SendGrid API errors
- Firebase authentication errors
- Memory/CPU usage spikes

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Failed

**Symptoms:** Deployment fails during build

**Solutions:**
- Check `package.json` has `"start": "node server.js"`
- Ensure all dependencies in `package.json`
- Check Railway build logs for specific errors

### Issue 2: MongoDB Connection Error

**Symptoms:** "MongoNetworkError" in logs

**Solutions:**
- Add `0.0.0.0/0` to MongoDB Network Access
- Verify connection string is correct
- Check database user credentials

### Issue 3: Firebase Auth Errors

**Symptoms:** Firebase initialization fails

**Solutions:**
- Ensure private key includes `\n` newlines
- Check all three Firebase variables are set
- Verify service account has Admin SDK role

### Issue 4: OTP Emails Not Sending

**Symptoms:** Send OTP returns error

**Solutions:**
- Verify SendGrid API key is correct
- Check sender email is verified in SendGrid
- Look for SendGrid errors in Railway logs
- Ensure SendGrid account is active

### Issue 5: CORS Errors from Android

**Symptoms:** Network requests fail from app

**Solutions:**
- Add `capacitor://localhost` to ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- Verify CORS middleware is configured
- Check Android uses HTTPS (not HTTP)

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Enable HTTPS (Railway does this automatically)
- Set strong JWT secret (64+ characters)
- Use rate limiting (already configured)
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor logs regularly
- Use different credentials for dev/prod

### ❌ DON'T

- Commit `.env` files to Git
- Use default passwords
- Allow all origins in CORS (`*`)
- Share API keys publicly
- Ignore security warnings
- Use HTTP in production

---

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### When to Upgrade

Monitor these metrics in Railway:

- **CPU Usage** > 70% consistently
- **Memory Usage** > 80% consistently
- **Response Time** > 2 seconds
- **Error Rate** > 1%

### Scaling Options

1. **Vertical Scaling** - Increase Railway resources
2. **Horizontal Scaling** - Multiple instances (Pro plan)
3. **Database Optimization** - Indexes, caching
4. **CDN** - For static assets
5. **Redis** - For session storage & caching

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- ✅ Health check returns 200 OK
- ✅ OTP emails arrive < 1 minute
- ✅ Android app connects successfully
- ✅ No errors in logs for 1 hour
- ✅ Response time < 2 seconds
- ✅ MongoDB connection stable
- ✅ Socket.io connects for chat
- ✅ File uploads work
